<h1 id="paper-summary">Paper Summary</h1>
<h2 id="minute-summary">2-minute Summary</h2>
<p>Almost all good research papers try to provide an answer a specific question. (Sometimes the question is a natural one that people specifically set out to answer; sometimes a good idea just ends up answering a worthwhile question.) If you can succinctly describe a paper, you have probably recognized the question the authors started with with and the answer they provide. Once you have focused on the main idea, you can go back and try to outline the paper to gain insight into more specific details. Indeed, if summarizing the paper in one or two sentences is easy, go back and try to deepen your outline by summarizing the three or four most important subpoints of the main idea.</p>

<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>Suppose there exists some feature set <span class="math">\(x\)</span> such that its linear transformation maps to the ground-truth (object/crowd) density function i.e. <span class="math">\[
F_i(p) = w^T x_p^i
\]</span> whereas <span class="math">\(x_p^i\)</span> is feature value at pixel <span class="math">\(p\)</span> in image <span class="math">\(i\)</span>. Then this linear transformation can be learned by minimizing the following equation <span class="math">\[
w = \underset{w}{\arg\min} \bigg( w^T w + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{N} dist\big( F_i^0(.), F_i(. \vert w)\big ) \bigg)
\]</span></p>
<p>Given a set of images <span class="math">\(I_1, I_2, ..., I_N\)</span> and a ground-truth density map <span class="math">\(F_i^0(p)\)</span> for each image <span class="math">\(i\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\sum_{p \in I_i} F_i^0(p)\)</span> equals the total number of objects present in the image then a set of parameters <span class="math">\(w\)</span> can be learned such that the mapping function <span class="math">\(F_i(p \vert w)\)</span> results in minimum error over the whole dataset.</p>
