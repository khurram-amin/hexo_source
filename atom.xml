<h1 id="minute-summary">2-minute Summary</h1>
<p>Almost all good research papers try to provide an answer a specific question. (Sometimes the question is a natural one that people specifically set out to answer; sometimes a good idea just ends up answering a worthwhile question.) If you can succinctly describe a paper, you have probably recognized the question the authors started with with and the answer they provide. Once you have focused on the main idea, you can go back and try to outline the paper to gain insight into more specific details. Indeed, if summarizing the paper in one or two sentences is easy, go back and try to deepen your outline by summarizing the three or four most important subpoints of the main idea.</p>

<p>Almost all good research papers try to provide an answer a specific question.

If you can succinctly describe a paper, you have probably recognized the question the authors started with with and the answer they provide.

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<h3 id="how-to-automatically-count-objects">How to automatically count objects?</h3>
<p>Suppose there exists some feature set <span class="math">\(x\)</span> such that its linear transformation maps to the ground-truth (object/crowd) density function i.e. $ F_i(p) = w^T x_p^i $ whereas <span class="math">\(x_p^i\)</span> is feature value at pixel <span class="math">\(p\)</span> in image <span class="math">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then this linear transformation can be learned by solving the following equation <span class="math">\[
w = \underset{w}{\arg\min} \bigg( w^T w + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{N} dist\big( F_i^0(.), F_i(. \vert w)\big ) \bigg)
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="how-to-measure-dist.-.">How to measure <span class="math">\(dist(. , .)\)</span></h3>
<p>Authors have defined a novel distance measure known as <em>MESA: Maximum Excess over SubArrays</em>. Given an image <span class="math">\(I\)</span>, the MESA distance <span class="math">\(D_{MESA}\)</span> between two functions <span class="math">\(F_1(p)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(F_2(p)\)</span> is defined as the largest absolute difference between sums of <span class="math">\(F_1(p)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(F_2(p)\)</span> over all box subarrays in <span class="math">\(I\)</span>: <span class="math">\[
D_{MESA}( F_1, F_2 ) = \underset{B \in \textbf{B} }{max} \bigg \vert \sum_{p \in B} F_1(p) - \sum_{p \in B} F_2(p) \bigg \vert
\]</span> To compute <span class="math">\(D_{MESA}\)</span> they take multiple windows (rectangles) over the image known as box hypothesis <strong>B</strong> then <span class="math">\(D_{MESA}\)</span> is simply the sum of absolute difference between two windows (rectangles) that differ most.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-establish-ground-truth-density">How to establish ground-truth density?</h3>
<p>Since objects (crowd) are discrete in nature i.e.Â there does exists a well defined boundary, in physical world, between two persons then it is easier to individually mark (with a dot) each object separately. But the process of converting this sparse marking into a continuous heat-map is not trivial. Authors have defined the object-density-map as <span class="math">\[
\forall p \in I_i,  F_i^0(p) = \sum_{P \in \textbf{P}_i} Normal(p; P, \sigma^2 1_{2 \times 2})
\]</span> Here, <span class="math">\(p\)</span> denotes a pixel, <span class="math">\(Normal(p; P, \sigma^2 1_{2 \times 2})\)</span> denotes a normalized Gaussian kernel evaluated at pixel <span class="math">\(p\)</span> with mean at the user placed dot <span class="math">\(P\)</span> and an isotropic covariance matrix with <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> being a small value.</p>
<!--Given a set of images $I_1, I_2, ..., I_N$ and a ground-truth density map $F_i^0(p)$ for each image $i$ such that $\sum_{p \in I_i} F_i^0(p)$ equals the total number of objects present in the image then a set of parameters $w$ can be learned such that the mapping function $F_i(p \vert w)$ results in minimum error over the whole dataset. -->
